Codaset Dialog is a sexy, ajax only jQuery dialog window.
==============================================================================================

It was built with one purpose, and one purpose only, and that is to allow the user to open up
a page via ajax in a great looking dialog window. It's not a slideshow or a thickbox clone,
and it doesn't solve global warming. It's simply a great way to open up a new page without the
need for a brand new page reload.



Implementation...
==============================================================================================

Reference the JS and CSS in the head of your HTML, not forgetting you need jQuery too. Then all
you need to do is add a new class name to any link that you want opening up in a dialog. Just
like this:

    <a href="http://codaset.com/joelmoss/codaset-dialog" class="dialog">ooohh, look at this ma!</a>
    
Any link with the class name of "dialog", will open that location within the dialog window upon
click. That is it! You don't even need to specify the dialog size, as the plugin will figure that
out for you. All you gotta do is use good HTML markup.
